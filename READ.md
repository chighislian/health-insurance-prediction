# 🏥 Health Insurance Charges Prediction

## 📖 Overview

Healthcare costs vary widely depending on personal and lifestyle factors. This project builds a machine learning model that predicts individual medical insurance charges using demographic and health-related data.

The project walks through a complete data science pipeline, starting from raw data exploration to building and evaluating predictive regression models.

The objective is to understand which factors most influence insurance costs and to develop an accurate prediction model using real-world data.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Insurance providers determine premium charges using multiple risk indicators. Accurately predicting these costs can help:
	•	Insurance companies estimate pricing risks
	•	Individuals understand factors affecting healthcare expenses
	•	Analysts gain insights into healthcare cost drivers

This project predicts insurance charges based on personal and lifestyle attributes.
